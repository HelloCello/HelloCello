-  Hi, I’m Alison and I'm HelloCello because I play cello!

- 👀 I’m a first year software engineer, looking forward to meeting my corporation's cloud engineering cert goals and more! 

I want to help underserved communities access, understand, and utilize available 21st century technologies. I'm also interested in providing cybersecurity and general support to elderly and isolated people in need. 

- 💞️ I'm interested in collaborating on projects with / for women, especially iterative + sensory friendly creative endeavors, instructional design consultations, and more. I'm also down to chat with any experienced developers willing to give me a chance to lend a hand and learn by doing!
