-  Hi, I’m Alison and I'm HelloCello because I play cello!
- 👀 I’m a former public school teacher/administrator interested in pivoting into tech and making the world more inclusive. My goal is to help marginalized communities access, share and utilize available 21st century technology. I'm also interested in providing cybersecurity and general support services to elderly and isolated people in need. My dream is to become such a proficient coder that I can finally engineer the projects out of my imagination and share them with others.
- 🌱 I just earned my CompTIA A+ certification and have been studying JavaScript to prepare for the Hack Reactor entrance exam. Wish me luck!
- I'm looking for work in IT, web development, and instructional design 
- 💞️ I'm interested in collaborating on projects by/with/for women, and also with any experienced developers willing to give me a chance to participate and lend a hand!
