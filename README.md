- 👋 Hi, I’m Alison, AKA @PoodlesInTech!
- 👀 I’m a former public school teacher/administrator + current professional classical musician interested in pivoting into tech and making the world more inclusive! My goal is to help marginalized communities access, share and utilize available 21st century technology. I'm also interested in providing cybersecurity and general support services to people/groups in need. My dream is to become such a proficient coder that I can finally engineer the projects out of my imagination and share them with others.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning IT support, web development, and cybersecurity 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects by/with/for women, and also with any experienced developers willing to give me a chance to participate and lend a hand!
