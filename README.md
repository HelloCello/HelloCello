-  Hi, I’m Alison and I'm HelloCello because I play cello!

- 👀 I’m a first year software engineer, looking forward to meeting my corporation's cloud engineering cert goals and more! 

I want to help marginalized communities access, share and utilize available 21st century technology. I'm also interested in providing cybersecurity and general support services to elderly and isolated people in need. 

My dream is to become such a proficient coder that I can problem solve my way into engineering a softer, more nurturing world for all living beings.

- I'm passionate about constantly learning, iterative + sensory friendly creative endeavors, and instructional design 

- 💞️ I'm interested in collaborating on projects with / for women, and also with any experienced developers willing to give me a chance to participate and lend a hand!
